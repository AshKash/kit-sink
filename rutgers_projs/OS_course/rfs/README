The report is in rfs2_report.pdf. This is package was tested on paul,
ece, pathfinder(internal use) and on aramis servers.

To setup the server, do the following:
Create /tmp/os_dfs on all machines where server runs. Then populate this 
directory and put a README file. This already done on paul.
Then run the server:
./server <port to bind>

The server asks for hostnames of all servers, enter and end with a "."
For the first server simply enter a "."
All servers must be started on the same port!!! Please make sure of this.

To run the client:
./client <server name> <server port>

The client will print the README file and then create a file called
"write_file" on the backend server.

If these happen, then the test has succeeded.

To run the perf_test, remove stale "big_file"s from the /tmp/os_dfs
directory and restart servers. Run the test program as usual.
