 * This module encapsulates the TEMP sensor.  It automatically gives the correct
 * commands to the ADC and then returns the sensor reading to the application with
 * the DATA_READY event.  
 * 
 * It is partially implemented by the TEMP.c file and also the TEMP.desc file. 
 * TEMP.desc file includes the ADC and the wiring between the ADC and the TEMP component.
