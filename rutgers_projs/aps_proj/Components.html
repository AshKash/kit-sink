<h1>TinyOS System Components</h1>
<p>AM handler sets -- Application level component (use or build multiple)&nbsp;</p>
<p>AM_BEACON.c -- Application that periodically broadcasts out identity
information.&nbsp; On each clock interrupt, it sends out a predetermined packet
of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>AM_BOUNCER.c -- Equivalent to a 'ping' handler.&nbsp; Accepts a packet coming
in from the network and responds with a packet sent back to the original sender.</p>
<p>AM_ECHO.c -- A component that forwards data through a node. Essentially, this
is a router for a source based routing algorithm.&nbsp; The packet already
contains the route to the destination. This handler receives the packet and retransmits
it out to the next hop on the list.&nbsp; The handler also modifies the list so
that the packet contains the return address by the time it arrives at the recipient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AM_LIGHT.c -- A component that I have no idea what it does. It probably
accepts a messages request to check the light sensor and send back the result.</p>
<p>AM_ROUTE.c -- A multi-hop routing application designed to discover a minimum
depth spanning tree and forward the use the tree to send sensor readings back to
a central base station.&nbsp; Each node listens for data that it needs to
retransmit on behalf of other nodes.&nbsp; Distant nodes use intermediate nodes
as stepping stones for their data.&nbsp; Each re-transmission brings the data
closer to the base station.</p>
<p>AM_temp.c&nbsp; -- A component that I have no idea what it does. It probably
accepts a messages request to check the light sensor and send back the result.</p>
<p>&quot;Main&quot; level object&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAIN.c&nbsp; Required component that initializes the system and starts the
scheduler. All applications must include this component.&nbsp; Additionally,
currently, the node's ID number is encoded in this file.</p>
<p>sched.c&nbsp; System Scheduler, must be included in all applications.&nbsp;
This is a simple fifo scheduler that is used to schedule the tasks.&nbsp; When a
component calls POST_TASK, the scheduler places that task in a FIFO queue.&nbsp;
When there is nothing else for the CPU to do, a task is pulled off the front of
the FIFO queue and executed to completion.</p>
<p>Active Message Layers (use one)&nbsp;</p>
<p>AM.c - stand alone NSD AM layer.&nbsp; When a packet arrives the this module
checks the address of the packet and then dispatches the message to the
appropriate message handler.&nbsp; In the event that the handler is not present
on the device, the packet is dropped.&nbsp; This layer checks that either the
address is equal to the local address or it is equal to the broadcast address
(0xff).</p>
<p>AM_BASE.c - base station NSD with UART forwarding.&nbsp; This component
behaves the same as the AM.c component EXCEPT that if a packet is sent to the
address 0x7e, it is directed to the UART instead of the RADIO.&nbsp; The address
0x7e is permanently assigned to the UART of a computer attached to a base
station.&nbsp; This component that both a Radio Packet Transport layer component
and a UART Packet Transport component are present.</p>
<p>Radio Packet Transport Layer (use one)&nbsp;</p>
<p>PACKETOBJ.c -raw 30 byte packet.&nbsp; This component takes a pointer to a 30
byte array to be sent down to the byte level component below it.&nbsp; It hands
the bytes down to the byte level component one at a time.&nbsp; As the byte
level component completes the transmission of a byte, a subsequent byte is
handed down.&nbsp; Additionally, as bytes arrive up from the network, this
component accepts the bytes one at a time until all 30 have arrived.&nbsp; Once
a full packet is sent/received the component fires the packet_send_done or
packet_receive_done event.</p>
<p>CRCPACKETOBJ.c -packet layer component that checks for CRC validity.&nbsp;
This component performs the same function as the basic PACKETOBJ.c component except
that it transmits and additional two bytes.&nbsp; These two bytes are a CRC
calculation performed over the packet. On the receiving end, the CRC is
recalculated and compared with the CRC value that was received.&nbsp; If they do
not match, the packet is dropped.&nbsp; If they do match the component fires the
packet_recieved_event.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>REDPACKET redundancy&nbsp; packet - This packet level component takes in 10
BYTE PACKETS and then sends the data out in triplicate.&nbsp; The ten bytes are
transmitted 3 times to form a 30 byte packet.&nbsp; Upon arrival the three
copies are used to perform error correction. In the event that two of the three
copies are the same (on a byte-by-byte basis), majority vote wins.&nbsp; In the
event that all three copies are different, then the packet is dropped.</p>
<p>UART Packet Transport Layer&nbsp;</p>
<p>UART_PACKET.c -sends packets to the UART&nbsp;&nbsp; this packet level
component is almost identical to the PACKETOBJ.c component except it is designed
to be used with the UART.c byte level component.</p>
<p>Radio Byte Engine (use one)&nbsp; -- all devices in the network must use the
same radio encoding component.</p>
<p>FOUR_B_RADIO_BYTE.c - 4b/6b encoding - A byte level component used&nbsp; with
the RFM component. This component accepts bytes from the packet layer componet,
encodes them for transmission, and passes the bits down to the RFM component one
at a time.&nbsp; This component uses a 4b/6b encoding scheme. Each 8bit byte is
transformed into 12 bits for transmission. This is done in order to satisfy the
radio's DC-balance requirement.&nbsp; As bits arrive from the radio, this
component first checks to see if a valid start symbol arrives from the
network.&nbsp; One a start symbol is found, the component collects the bits
together into a byte worth, decodes the byte and then sends the decoded byte up
to the packet layer.</p>
<p>RADIO_BYTE.c - manchester encoding&nbsp; This performs the same function as
the FOUR_B_RADIO_BYTE except it uses a Manchester encoding scheme that takes in
a 8-bit symbol and produces a 16 bit symbol, once again, this is done in order
to satisfy the radio's dc-balance requirement.</p>
<p>UART Byte Engine&nbsp;</p>
<p>UART.c --This component takes bytes one at a time and transmitts them over
the UART.&nbsp; When the component is ready to handle another byte, it fires the
tx_done event. When a byte arrives from the UART, the component fires the
byte_arrival event. </p>
<p>Lower level device components </p>
<p>CLOCK.c - signals periodic events.&nbsp; It initialized with the interval
with witch to fire the event and then periodically fires the CLOCK_EVENT at that
rate. The possible initialization values are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>0x0 - disable the event</li>
  <li>0x1 - fire once every 1/256 of a second</li>
  <li>0x2</li>
  <li>0x3</li>
  <li>0x4</li>
  <li>0x5</li>
  <li>0x6</li>
  <li>0x7</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PHOTO.c - access photo sensor </p>
<p>RFM.c - RFM radio interface</p>
<p>RFM_LOW_POWER.c - low power interface to RFM radio. </p>
<p>Temp.c - temperature sensor </p>
<p>MOTE_I2C_obj.c </p>
