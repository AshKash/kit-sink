UART tools for PC-simulated motes.

files:
uartd.pl - daemon to listen to mote UART code
uartc.pl - client to talk to daemon

How to use:
1. start uartd.pl
2. connect to uartd using uartc.pl
3. start mote code

The only part of this order which is mandatory is step 1 - no uartc or
mote can connect until the daemon is running.  The reason to connect uartc 
first is to allow the data to begin to flow immediately if the mote starts
outputting to its UART immediately.  uartd will fork off a separate 
process for each client/mote pair.  To stop the simulation, send uartd a 
SIGINT; it will kill all remaining child processes before exiting.  

The client is basically just a proxy which passes characters typed on 
STDIN to uartd over the socket.  uartd then passes the data from the 
client to the mote via the other socket.  The same process also happens in 
reverse when data originates at the mote.  

The only special feature of the client at this point is sending a file to 
the mote.  This file can be ASCII or binary as it is read in character 
mode.  To send a file, type ^F and input the filename when prompted.  The 
file will echo to the screen along with any data received from the mote.  

This is the first release.  Extensions and/or feature suggestions are 
encouraged.  

This is intended to be used with the mote UART code I modified to use the 
socket at the byte level (originally it was implemented at the packet 
level).  Receiving from the mote does work with the packet-level code 
though, if anyone has reason to use it.
