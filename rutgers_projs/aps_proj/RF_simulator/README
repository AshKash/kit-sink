This program is run with:

java ConnectionManager

This module forwards messages between simulated motes.  Each mote sends 
it's packets to this module which forwareds it to those motes that
are "in range"  the connection graph is determined by 
what entries have been added to the connection manager's list with the
 void add_conn(int a, int b) function, where a and b are the id's of two 
motes.  

As is, there is a connection between all motes 1-10.

You can change ConnectionManager.java as necessary to create the topology you
want.
