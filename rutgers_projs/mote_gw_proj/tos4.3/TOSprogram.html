<h1>
Tiny OS Networked Sensor Device (Mote) Programming</h1>

<p>
***In progress ***

<p><br>A TinyOS networked sensor device application is described by a graph
of software components, the lowest of which simply encapsulate the physical
hardware.&nbsp; Components have <i>state,</i> contained in their TOS frame,
<i>an
interface</i>, specifying what commands it implements, what events it signals,
what commands it uses, and what events it handles, and its internal logic,
including the functions implementing its interface and additional threads.&nbsp;
The combination of interface-based composition and internal concurrency
and state provides a smooth intermixing of hardware and software functionality.
<p>There are three aspects of programming networked sensor devices using
TinyOS:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#compose">composing a collection of components into a complete
application</a>,</li>

<li>
<a href="#app-component">developing a high-level application component,</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#hw-component">developing a low-level hardware-oriented component</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="compose"></a>Composing components into an application</h2>
A complete application is described by a graph of components.&nbsp; A typical
component has an 'upper-interface', consisting of the commands that it
implements (or accepts) and the events that it signals, and a 'lower-interface',
consisting of the commands that it uses and events that it handles.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lowest-level components provide only an upper-interface, as they are implemented
directly by physical hardware modules.&nbsp; They typically describe their
mapping to specific hardware resource, in lieu of a lower interface. The
other exception is the MAIN component, which has only a lower interface
providing the initialization commands into the application.<p>Composing an application involves specifying a collection of components
and 'wiring ' the command and event relationships between components.&nbsp;
TOS currently provides a set of tools that allow component composition
to be described using textual editors.&nbsp; We also have support for using
schmatic editing tools such as Workview Viewlogic to produce structural VHDL (only a small subset is used).&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>You should start with a working
.desc file, such as those contained in
the apps directory.&nbsp; The .desc file has two parts
<ul>
<li>
an includes portion, which lists the components to be used in the applicatoin</li>

<li>
a body which specifies where to connect each port of each of the
components.&nbsp; Each of the lines of the body contains a list of component
ports that are to be logically connected together.&nbsp; The list is space
separated with the ports listed as COMPONENT:PORT</li>

</ul>
The sequel describes what is in a <a href="#Basic Component Graph">basic
component graph</a> and a <a href="#Graph with Communication Components:">graph
using communication components</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3><a NAME="Basic Component Graph"></a>Components</h3>
<p>Components have two files that describe them 1)A .comp file which contains
the interface specification for the component. 2)A .c file that contains the
implementation of the component.&nbsp; The interface description contains 5
parts.</p>

<h3><a NAME="Basic Component Graph"></a>Basic Component Graph</h3>
<p>The following is drawn from the example apps/blink.vhd
<p>The list of components is simple:</p>
<p>include modules{<br>
MAIN;<br>
BLINK;<br>
CLOCK;<br>
LEDS;<br>
};</p>
<p>The body shows how the ports are all wired together.&nbsp; The names don't
matter, but it sure helps to make them meaningful.&nbsp; Here we see that the MAIN_SUB_INIT is wired to BLINK_INIT.&nbsp;
BLINK_SUB_INIT is wired to CLOCK_INIT.&nbsp; If there
is more than one IN port on a net, the tools will create the fan-out function
automatically.
<p>BLINK:BLINK_INIT MAIN:MAIN_SUB_INIT<br>
BLINK:BLINK_APP_DONE MAIN:MAIN_SUB_SEND_DONE<br>
BLINK:BLINK_LEDy_on LEDS:YELLOW_LED_ON<br>

<p>Most lower-level components provide an initialization command and a
power management command.
<p>You may have noticed an extra signal, AM_DISP.&nbsp; It is magic and
described below.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would rather follow the simple BLINK
example through, skip to <a href="#app-component">Building a Application
Component</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Graph with Communication Components:"></a>Graph with Communication
Components:</h3>
Application components that do communication will provide active message
handlers.&nbsp; Currently, in order for the tools to manage the handler
registration and dispatching, you need to follow some rather kludgy conventions.&nbsp;
The component port should be of the name AM_MSG_HANDLER_x, where x is a
number.&nbsp; Note capitalization.&nbsp; No two handlers in the application
should use the same number.&nbsp; The signal name that is used is AM_DISP(x)
- same x.&nbsp;&nbsp; The component file provides a function AM_msg_handler_x
(note change in case), that takes a point to the inbound message buffer
as argument.<p>These applications also needs a stack of components stretching down from
AM to the physical media.&nbsp; The AM component is generic to a wide range
of applications, so you will seldom need to change it. In order to assist with
the repetitive use of the same set of components, we have the ability to specify
complex components that are an assembly of basic components.&nbsp; One such component
is the GENERIC_COMM component which contains a complete RFM radio stack from the
Active Messages layer down to the bit processing layer.
<p>
A high-level application component will typically implement the upper initialization
commands, forward them to lower components as appropriate and then operate
in an event driven mode, as defined by the collection of event handlers.&nbsp;
The rules are these.&nbsp; Component FOO is described by FOO.c.&nbsp; The
declarations for each of the ports appear in the associated .h file and
the associated functions appear in the C file.&nbsp; The names used are
the port names.&nbsp; The C file will provide a function for every IN port.&nbsp;
It will invoke functions associated with OUT ports, using the port name.&nbsp;
Commands and events return control information and possibly data.&nbsp;
0 is treated as failure.&nbsp; Non-zero indicates success.&nbsp; This is
discussed more with respect to <a href="#datapumps">event-based data pumps</a><b>.</b>
<p>A component should not need to name functions in other components.&nbsp;
If it does, the modularity is broken.&nbsp; The tools will translate internal
names to external names, as specified by the .desc file.<h3>
<a NAME="app-component"></a>Application Component</h3>
<p>For the simple BLINK example above, we have the associated include file
BLINK.h containing:
<p><tt>#ifndef __blinkHEAD__</tt>
<br><tt>#define __blinkHEAD__</tt>
<p><tt>#include &quot;tos.h&quot;<br>
#include &quot;blink.h&quot;</tt>
<p><tt>//ACCEPTS:</tt>
<br><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(BLINK_INIT)();</tt>
<br><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(BLINK_START)();</tt>
<p><tt>//SIGNALS:</tt>
<p><tt>//HANDLES</tt>
<br><tt>void BLINK_CLOCK_EVENT();</tt>
<p><tt>//USES</tt>
<br><tt>char TOS_COMMAND(BLINK_SUB_INIT)(char interval);</tt>
<p><tt>#endif</tt>
<p>It must include the tos.h header file.
<h3><a NAME="FULLPC"></a>PC based TINYOS emulation.</h3>
<p>MakefilePC provides the hooks for building a emulation version of the
NSD application for debugging purposes.&nbsp; It even emulates the radio.&nbsp;
In the future, this support will be incoporated more transparently into
lower layers.
<p>It builds up some handy utilty functions, such as:
<p>void LEDy_on()
<br>{
<br>#ifdef FULLPC
<br>&nbsp; printf("Y");
<br>#else
<br>&nbsp; CLR_BLINK_LED1();
<br>#endif
<br>}<h3>
<a NAME="Memory-model"></a>Memory Model -- the FRAME</h3>
<p>It declares a frame to hold its internal state.&nbsp; Variable state
is only visible within this component and referenced as VAR(state).
<br>&nbsp;
<p>#define TOS_FRAME_TYPE BLINK_frame
<br>TOS_FRAME_BEGIN(BLINK_frame) {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char state;
<br>}
<br>TOS_FRAME_END(BLINK_frame);
<p>The implementation of the BLINK_INIT turns on all the LEDs and in turn
initializes the clock component.&nbsp; Notice, it refers to the internal
name BLINK_SUB_INIT, which is bound to CLOCK_INIT through the vBINIT signal.
<p>char TOS_COMMAND(BLINK_INIT)(){
<br>&nbsp; LEDy_on();&nbsp;&nbsp; LEDr_on();&nbsp;&nbsp; LEDg_on();
<br>&nbsp; TOS_COMMAND(BLINK_SUB_INIT)(0x03);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/* initialize clock component */
<br>&nbsp; VAR(state) = 0;
<br>&nbsp; return 1;
<br>}
<p>The BLINK_START command, which is invoked after initialization completes,
turns all the LEDs off and completes, returning success.
<p>char TOS_COMMAND(BLINK_START)(){
<br>&nbsp; LEDy_off();&nbsp; LEDr_off();&nbsp; LEDg_off();
<br>&nbsp; return 1;
<br>}
<p>The TOS scheduler puts the hardware into sleep mode when there is no
pending tasks.&nbsp; It remains sensitive to interrupts, such as the real-time
clock.&nbsp; BLINK handles this clock event.&nbsp; It increments a 3-bit
counter and sets the LEDs accordingly.
<p>/* Clock Event Handler:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; update LED state as 3-bit counter and set LEDs to match
<br>&nbsp;*/
<br>void BLINK_CLOCK_EVENT(){
<br>&nbsp; char state = VAR(state) = (VAR(state)+1) &amp; 7;
<br>&nbsp; if (state &amp; 1) LEDy_on();&nbsp; else LEDy_off();
<br>&nbsp; if (state &amp; 2) LEDg_on();&nbsp; else LEDg_off();
<br>&nbsp; if (state &amp; 4) LEDr_on();&nbsp; else LEDr_off();
<p>The BLINK compenent shows the command/event driven control aspect of
Tiny OS and the component modularity.&nbsp; More sophisticated components
demonstrate the use of the command/event protocol for data pumps for streaming
data across one or more component layers and the use of TOS threads to
provide internal concurrency.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the high-level application
component, these capabilities are project up simply as Active Message operations:
send command and arrival handler.&nbsp; These are illustrated by a simple
example CHIRP that periodically takes a sensor reading and broadcasts it
on the network.
