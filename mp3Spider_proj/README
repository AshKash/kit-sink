This program searches SMB shares of all available machines in the given
domain recursively, for files ending with .mp3. The results will
be written to the given file or to mp3Spider.out if none is specified.
The program is based on Norbert Hranitzky's jCifs client
(http://www.hranitzky.purespace.de/jcifs/jcifs.htm, which is quite diferent
from jCifs seen at jcifs.samba.org).

KNOWN ISSUES:
Will not enumerate more than 500 machines. 
Due to obscure reasons, jCifs will not enumerate shares whose names
are longer than 12 characters (This behaviour is also seen in smbclient).
Program creates one thread per machine, this can bog down your
machine!
JDK1.3 is needed for this to work.
