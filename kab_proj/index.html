<h1>What is AdBlock Plus?</h1>
From their website:
<blockquote>
<em>
Annoyed by adverts? Troubled by tracking? Bothered by banners? 
Install Adblock Plus now to regain control of the internet and change the 
way that you view the web. You can also choose from over forty filter 
subscriptions  to automatically configure the add-on for purposes ranging from 
removing online advertising to blocking all known malware domains.
</em>
</blockquote>

<h2>Can we stop them?</h2>
You as the content owner would also like to assert your copyright over the 
material. Web site AD is critical to protect these revenues so content creators 
have incentives to produce interesting content. 
Obviously litigation will lead you nowhere! 

<h2>Some ideas</h2>
I have written a tool in Python to scan HTML, the AD material and the URLs 
serving them are identified and partially encrypted. When the client makes 
a request for the main document, the partially encrypted version of the document 
is sent that will later be decrypted (via Javascript). The non encrypted parts 
will contain links (or other information) to the advertisement, 
all non-advertisement, non-script information inside the HTML body is encrypted. 
When the browser renders the document, the content appears scrambled and 
unintelligible. A typical browser (that is not using adblock) will then 
attempt to download the ads as these are the only links in the document. 
When a request to download the ad is made, a decryption key is sent as a 
cookie (or other means). Eventually all ads will be downloaded and a page load 
event is generated. A special javascript function will be called when this 
event is triggered. This function will have access to the secret key that 
was sent, using which the document is decrypted. After this, the entire 
document tree is traversed and verified - that all the objects have been 
loaded (one such mechanism is using checksums), otherwise the decrypted page 
will not be rendered and instead an error message will be displayed. 

<h2>Some Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>What about the search engines indexing? - Can probably be solved by detecting 
the search engine. Moreover, the page is partially encrypted.
</li>
<li>What about performance? - I am using RC4, 128bit keys the base64 
encoding it and it pretty snappy.
</li>
<li>
Can I use this with dynamic content? - This is easy, send me an email if you 
are interested in doing this.
</li>
<li>
Can I control which parts are encrypted? - Yes, if you hand code the
&lt;div&gt; sections. The demo tool will not do this for you.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Demos</h1>
<p>For the demo to work correctly, we need server side support (PHP), since I
cannot get this from Rutgers, here is a <a href="staticdemo.html">
static demo page</a>.
</p>

<p>Please contact me if you are interested with the tool</p>
