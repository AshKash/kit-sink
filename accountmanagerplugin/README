Configuring ldap backend. Put this in your trac.ini and configure it:
{{{
[account-manager]
ldap_basedn = OU=WWW,OU=Employees,OU=People,DC=www,DC=example,DC=com     # You need to get this from windows for your AD
ldap_pass = the_ldap_password
ldap_uri = ldap://your.ldap.server.name/
ldap_user = ldap_user_to_login  # Anonymous binds might not work as windows ADs do not let you list users / emails with anonymous binds
notify_actions = new,delete
password_store = LdapAuthStore
}}}

LDAP changes added by Ashwin (reverse chronological order):

 * Rework add/remove feature. 

 * Reworked to make use of Agilo's team member add/remove facilities

 * Do not allow non LDAP users to be added
 * trac_admin cannot be deleted
 * Cannot set name/email (must be fetched from LDAP)

 * Adding decent templates for emails.

 * Fix password in trac.ini
 * Fix notification issue with user not present

 * trac_admin can login via /login2. trac_admin is a special admin user who can never be deleted.

 * Refactor code and handle exceptions and LDAP misconfigurations nicely
 * We now have a new /login2 entry point that can be used to manually login 
 * Still need to make is work since the check_password routine talks to LDAP and not to DB

 * Added LdapAuthStore. 
 * Please enable this and configure it (in Accounts/Configuration) if you want to use it. Currently, the domain LDAP server needs a valid AD user and pass to do a bind and fetch emails and names
 * When you add a new user, his email and fullname will be fetched from LDAP and filled in the DB. 
 * Auth has not been tested.
 * Please use mod_autenntlm with apache.

 * Add accountmanager
