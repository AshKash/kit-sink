        AjaxCrypt</h2>
    <p>
        How can you transmit Tweets or web chat messages securely without using HTTPS for
        every message? Is it possible to do it 100% securely? Can we solve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">
            MITM</a> issues
        that has plagued current encryption solutions like <a href="http://assl.sullof.com/assl/">
                aSSL</a> and <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/javascrypt/">JavaScrypt</a>?
        Can we get good performance and over clock SSL as <a href="http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html">

    <p>
        We propose a secure alternative to HTTPS based on standard browser security available
        today. Our proposal has lower server side resource consumption, enables caching
        of encrypted content, and provides a low latency client-server communication.</p>
    <p>
        If you have feedback, contact Ashwin Kashyap, email: ashwink -&gt; cs.rutgers.edu.
        I am looking for opportunities in areas of search &amp; discovery, recommendation
        systems, data mining, video recommendation.</p>
    <h3>Quick intro for the initiated</h3>
<ul>
<li>Statically encrypt and publish content on HTTP server</li>
<li>Transmit these via HTTP to an iframe component at client browser</li>
<li>HTTP-iframe locally sends message to HTTPS-iframe via window.postMessage()</li>
<li>HTTPS-iframe decrypts content (with pre-shared key) and renders it on page</li>
</ul>
As you can (hopefully) see this is 100% secure - as secure as HTTPS! But as performant as HTTP.
    <h2>
        What is the big problem?</h2>
    <p>
        HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that offers server authentication and communication
        encryption and authentication. Its limitations lies in the required processing power
        that can be quite steep, as well as in a high latency to setup a connection due
        to authentication and key establishment HTTPS also does not offer caching of encrypted
        content as the entire HTTPS communication is encrypted differently for each session.
        Even if alternate protocols can solve these problems, none of them is backward compatible
        nor works with existing widely deployed web technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        We propose a method that combines HTTP, HTTPS and Javascript that provides secure,
        low latency communication, is backwards compatible and works in any Javascript enabled
        browser. This method is as secure as HTTPS, while the server side resource requirements
        are the same as for regular HTTP.</p>

    <h2>
        Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>MITM</b> – man-in-the-middle, a type of attack in which the attacker places itself
            between the communicating entities, indeed impersonating each of them in front of
            the other.</li>
        <li><b>HTTP</b> – An insecure protocol to transfer data from server to client. We use
            this here for illustrative purposes and our invention can be applied or extended
            to use any insecure protocol such as FTP instead of HTTP.</li>
        <li><b>HTTPS</b> – A secure protocol that resists MITM and is an alternative to HTTP.
            We use this here for illustrative purposes and our invention can be applied or extended
            to use any secure protocol, including secure simple local file access.</li>
        <li><b>HTTP-blobs</b> – Any opaque data that can be retrieved via HTTP from the server.
            In our context, it is some document or message that is sensitive and must be encrypted.</li>
        <li><b>HTTP-delegate</b> – A component delivered via HTTP that contains the methods
            needed to request other HTTP objects and methods to communicate with the HTTPS-stub.
            It might, but not necessarily carry identities or links to these HTTP-blobs.</li>
        <li><b>HTTPS-stub</b> – A component securely delivered via HTTPS that contains the shared
            secret, the decode routines and methods to communicate with the HTTP-delegate. It
            should be impossible to get this object via HTTP or any other insecure means.</li>
        <li><b>Cross domain</b> – A sandboxing mechanism in web-browsers particularly that prevents
            access to pages or objects across different domains. The DNS name, protocol and
            port is taken into consideration to determining a domain.</li>
        <li><b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model, a standard API to access and manipulate elements
            on a HTML page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Should be as secure as HTTPS – resist man-in-the-middle (MITM), DNS spoofing, code
            injection, etc.</li>
        <li>Should reduce communication round trips when compared to HTTPS.</li>
        <li>Should reduce server overhead in terms of CPU and memory.</li>
        <li>Should work in any current web browser with Javascript enabled.</li>
        <li>Should offer encrypted documents caching at proxies, CDNs etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        A solution</h2>
    <p>
        <img width="612" height="480" src="ajaxcrypt_files/image001.gif"></p>
    <p>
        <b>Figure 1: System architecture</b></p>
    <p>
        The idea behind this invention is to encrypt sensitive web documents such as emails,
        spreadsheets or chat messages using a symmetric key. These encrypted blobs might
        be stored or just transit through the server (e.g. chat). The server relays the
        blobs to a suitably authenticated client via HTTP which is then decrypted by the
        HTTPS-stub and suitably rendered for human interaction.</p>
    <p>
        The first step in the process is for the user to authenticate. Once successful,
        a HTTP-delegate and HTTPS-stub are transmitted back, either standalone or embedded
        in another page. When the user wishes to access a sensitive document, the corresponding
        HTTP-blob is requested by the HTTP-delegate via HTTP. This cannot be retrieved directly
        by the HTTPS-stub due to cross domain restrictions imposed on scripts. The retrieved
        blob is then transferred to the HTTPS-stub, which proceeds to authenticate the blob
        and processes it. See Figure 1 for an illustration of this. Due to performance requirements,
        the blobs must be transmitted via HTTP, but for security, the processing must be
        performed by the HTTPS-stub. Note that the HTTP-delegate cannot access the contents
        of the HTTPS-stub due to cross domain security restrictions imposed by browsers.
        However, it is possible to send messages that can be validated and further processed
        by the stub. This ensures that a hacked HTTP-delegate cannot steal information from
        the secure HTTPS-stub. It also ensures that tampered messages can be reliably detected
        and discarded. See figures 2a, 2b and 2c for flowcharts depicting these processes.</p>
    <p>
        One implementation of our idea is to construct the HTTP-delegate and HTTPS-stub
        as iframes. All communication and decryption routines are implemented as Javascripts
        that run in the context of the iframe. These two iframes communicate by sending
        messages as described in the next section. In our prototype, we have successfully
        performed the transfer using the RC4 algorithm.</p>
    <p>
        A patent application has been filed embodying these ideas.</p>

    <h3>
        Cross domain communications</h3>
    <p>
        Our scheme assumes that the HTTPS-stub can retrieve encrypted messages via HTTP
        and decrypt them. This cannot be done directly due to security restrictions placed
        on Javascript that prevent cross domain information exchange. We need these security
        restrictions - otherwise the HTTP components can simply access secrect keys! But
        this also means that none
        of the DOM APIs can be used to access components from another domain to transfer
        messages. This is applicable even if the HTTP and HTTPS server are one and the same,
        with the same FQDN, as it still constitutes cross domain due to the protocol and
        ports being different. There are several ways to overcome this problem without using
        Flash or Java or a custom plug-in.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Here are some solutions:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>window.location.hash</b> - Use the window.location.hash DOM object to exchange
            information between the HTTPS-stub and the HTTP-delegate securely. This method works
            in almost all existing browsers and is secure as the messages are validated before
            being processed. </li>
        <li><b>Cookie</b> - The HTTP-delegate first fetches the blob and then sets a cookie
            whose content is the blob, using standard Javascript methods. The HTTPS-stub then
            reads the cookie and processes it appropriately. This again is secure as the stub
            validates the cookie before processing it further.</li>
        <li><b>window.postMessage()</b> – In future it will be possible to use the window.postMessage()
            and document.addEventListener() functions to accomplish the communication.
            These methods have been added to the upcoming HTML 5 standard and already available
            in some browsers. They also allow authentication of messages by verifying the originating
            domain etc. Since this method is implemented natively in the browser, it is fast
            and provides a clean mechanism to accomplish the communication. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In our prototype, we have implemented the window.postMessage() method. It is nevertheless
        possible to implement a combination of these methods to make sure that it works
        on older browsers as well as to take advantage of newer features if present. So,
        the actual method to use can be determined (for e.g. after the user has been authenticated)
        by probing for the browser’s feature set or by detecting the version.</p>
    <h3>
        Security considerations</h3>
    <p>
        We assume that standard secure encryption routines are available at server side
        and that the decrypt routines on the client side can be implemented in Javascript
        securely. This also applies while validating data – there are many signature verification
        schemes available that are secure with an available Javascript implementation. There
        are also various schemes that can be used (such as key refresh) while implementing
        decryption routines to enhance security and performance. We assume that these shall
        be implemented securely and suitably by someone a skilled in the field and hence
        we shall not address these issues as they are orthogonal to our invention. Below,
        we address a few issues that might arise that did not exist with standard HTTPS.</p>
    <h4>
        Secure domain for blobs</h4>
    <p>
        One class of attacks is to publish a malicious page which embeds the HTTP-delegate.
        When a gullible user is tricked into visiting the page, it is possible for the malicious
        page to request sensitive information from the HTTP-delegate by sending it messages.
        Hence, it is important that the HTTP-delegate only retrieve encrypted blobs. This
        can be easily achieved by publishing the HTTP-delegate on a separate domain that
        only serves blobs to authenticated users – for e.g. blobs.somedomain.com for sending
        blobs and HTTP-delegate and secure.somedomain.com for sending the stub.</p>
    <h4>
        Embedded links in blobs</h4>
    <p>
        When the blob has links to other blobs, these links must be retrieved and processed.
        One way to handle this is to load all referenced links in the blob by a Javascript
        function instead of a direct request. This function, which is implemented in the
        HTTPS-stub, first sends a message containing the URL of the blob to the HTTP-delegate,
        requesting it to download it. Once the blob has been retrieved, the rest of the
        process is the same as what has been previously described. In our prototype, we
        have implemented a proxy object that mimics the well known XMLHttpRequest object,
        but works in a cross domain fashion. Callbacks can be specified to process decrypted
        data.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Caching</h4>
    <p>
        Most browsers use the following policy to cache HTTPS documents: they do not store
        them on disk but only cache it in memory, which is cleared when the user navigates
        away from the website. This behavior provides the right balance between security
        and performance as it would be unacceptable to reload the stub whenever a new blob
        is loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the blobs are being served by HTTP, they might be cached on disk or even at
        intermediates such as proxies. This will not pose a security risk as the blobs are
        strongly encrypted using a key with high entropy and not simply the user’s password.
        These keys can also be periodically refreshed to enhance security.</p>
    <h2>
        Performance</h2>
    <p>
        This scheme cannot be generally used as a HTTPS replacement. For some situations,
        it might be better and faster to simply encrypt everything with HTTPS. However,
        when there is a large collection of documents that are small in size and the client
        accesses them sporadically or to make sporadic remote procedure calls (RPCs), our
        proposed method will be way more efficient. This is the typical scenario for web
        email, web spreadsheets, web chat etc. In this situation, it is impractical to maintain
        a client-server keep-alive HTTPS connection – as the overhead of doing this for
        millions of users is extremely high. Without using keep-alive, a new HTTPS connection
        must be established for fetching small amounts of data. In such a situation, the
        overhead of establishing the HTTPS connection easily outweighs the transmission
        time for the small message. This is because, in order to establish a HTTPS connection,
        several parameters must be negotiated between the client and the server and this
        causes multiple round-trip information exchanges. Technologies such as hardware
        decryption and SSL connection reuse are not useful here as the problem is not CPU
        bound but is due to the excessive round trip message exchanges. In our system, both
        the HTTP-delegate and HTTPS-stub are cached in the browser and the HTTP-blobs are
        fetched via HTTP. It is also much lighter from a resource consumption perspective
        to maintain HTTP keep-alive connections as HTTP is stateless.</p>
    <p>
        Figure 3 shows a benchmark to perform RPCs (using JSON-RPC) between a client and
        a server. The server is a fast 4-way P4 machine with several gigabytes of RAM. The
        network is a 1GBps Ethernet network with average latencies of less than 0.5ms. We
        used an Apache web server and ApacheBench to perform the benchmark. The concurrency
        on the x-axis represents the number of ApacheBench instances that were run simultaneously.
        ApacheBench was also patched to handle SSL reuse correctly. The SSLCipherSuite in
        Apache configuration was RC4-MD5 which is the fastest available. The server certificate
        used was RSA 1024 bit.</p>
    <p>
        Brief note on terminology – “https_reuse” and “https_noreuse” refer to a SSL feature
        that enables caching of the negotiated master key. “ka” and “noka” is respectively,
        whether keep-alive is used or not. Lastly, “http” and “https” refer to the underlying
        protocol used for transport.</p>
    <p>
        Note that typical latency on the internet is of the order of 20-30 ms, and the HTTPS
        numbers will be far worse in this scenario. It is clear that without keep-alive,
        it is extremely inefficient to use HTTPS. While https_ka is roughly 60% slower than
        http_ka, https_*_noka is almost 3000% slower than http_noka. This level of degradation
        is unacceptable for secure, scalable and interactive AJAX web sites.</p>
    <p>
        Fetching many small documents such as while reading web-email is very similar to
        performing RPCs as the data exchanged is small and the request pattern might be
        sporadic and unpredictable.</p>
    <p>
        Web based chat systems pose a similar problem where the payload is small and the
        communication is sporadic. With our method, it is possible to deploy a secure, highly
        scalable web based chat system.</p>

    <h2>
        Current Solutions</h2>
    <p>
        Below is a discussion of how others have implemented similar things in the past,
        including the manner in which others have attempted to solve the problem.</p>
    <h3>
        HTTPS solutions</h3>
    <p>
        Web security is often solved by using HTTPS, for efficiency and scalability, these
        solutions are often implemented in a hardware device. The encryption functions are
        delegated to a hardware component which exclusively encrypts content. This hardware
        acts as a reverse-proxy between the user and the HTTP server. The web server generates
        unencrypted content, transmits it to the hardware device that encrypts the content
        and transmits it to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        This enhancement does not solve the latency problem since HTTPS’ secure channel
        establishment inherently requires more round trips than HTTP. Even if the available
        bandwidth increases, the round trip essentially remains the same due to hard physical
        constraints such as the speed of light and limits in the switching fabric. Also,
        this does not solve the problem of keep-alive HTTPS connections as it is a stateful
        protocol and consumes a significant amount of memory. On the other hand, HTTP is
        a stateless protocol and is much lighter to have keep-alive connections for millions
        of users.</p>
    <p>
        For these reasons, several websites simply do not use HTTPS unless it is absolutely
        necessary.</p>
    <h3>
        aSSL – Ajax Secure Service Layer</h3>
    <p>
        aSSL is a web-application-level encryption and authentication system. It works by
        using a combination of Javascript and a server-side script. It provides encryption
        similar to HTTPS, by creating a secure layer from the browser to the server over
        HTTP. It prevents the content to be sniffed, but does not prevent a man-in-the-middle
        attack since there is currently no trust system for the public keys that are used,
        and also it is possible to modify the decrypt routines itself since it is transmitted
        over HTTP. The latter problem of delivering the decrypt routines over HTTPS is inherently
        secure and it cannot be solved. There are several solutions similar to this that
        assume that MITM does not occur and only partially solve the problem.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Batching</h3>
    <p>
        Many web applications batch data so that individual objects do not need to be retrieved
        when the user requests them. One good example of this is Gmail that fetches emails
        in batches of 20 and displays them only when the user requests them. This reduces
        frequent communication with the server and hence reduces latency even when HTTPS
        is used. The main limitation of this approach is that it cannot be applied to highly
        interactive applications such as web chat, Twitter or RPC request.</p>
    <h3>
        Application driven encryption</h3>
    <p>
        The idea of application driven encryption is to install an application on the user’s
        machine that decrypts the content received by the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        The password must be known to the user which has to be entered manually.</p>
    <p>
        Since the file is generated once and may be downloaded by the user, the password
        cannot be changed easily. Further more, due to the user interaction, the password
        cannot not be more than 10 or 15 characters. A typical example is to send an encrypted
        ZIP or PDF with pre-shared password. This is unsuitable for RPC applications.</p>
    <h3>
        Flash / Java object</h3>
    <p>
        Due to liberal security policies, it is possible to transmit a Flash object with
        the decode routines and key via HTTPS and embed it so that it can access data via
        HTTP. The secure Flash object can then decode data and display it suitably. The
        drawback of this approach is that the Flash plugin needs to be installed.
    </p>
    <h2>
        <b>Software</b></h2>
    <p>
        I have implemented a proof of concept, prototype. The server side encryption functions
        are statically performed using the openssl tool. Then the page components are deliveered
        using HTTP and HTTPS as described above. The HTTP iframe then fetches the encrypted
        content, transfers it to the HTTPS component which then renders the content.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Currently I do not plan to release it widely, it is also in need of a lot of refactoring
        work!</p>
    <p>
        If you would like to see a demo, please email me! I am working on putting it up
        shortly.</p>
